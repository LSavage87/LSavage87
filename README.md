Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lucy and I'm currently studying for my Data Science Level 6 Apprenticeship while working at Burberry.

I also completed a Level 4 apprenticeship in Data Science while I was working for my former employer, Asda.

I have worked in data analytics since 2017, moving into HR analytics in 2019.  I have experience in dashboard building in Tableau and PowerBI, and report building within systems and Excel/Power Query.

Through my apprenticeship, I am building on my coding experience in Python and SQL.  I particularly enjoy predictive analytics, machine learning, and creating visualisations.
